1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own, or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
   A. No, I found this lab exercise pretty straight-forward and easy to understand by watching videos.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

02-a11y lab exercise

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own, or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
   A. For this lab, since I already ran accessibility tests, identified and fixed errors and warning while doing my home work 1, I found it easy to do, but I checked the walkthrough video provided as link in week 3 overview in Canvas, just to make sure that everything I did is right.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
   A. Running an accessibility test using waveAIM extension, and identifying the errors is a challenging task. I am able to learn how to fix the errors by reading the error and alert messages and learned how to fix them. The identification of errors and alerts in radio buttons helped understand the importance of label and input association.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
   A. No, I found this lab exercise pretty straight-forward and easy to understand.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
   A. Even though this lab has only one exercise, and I did it easily, as I learned to run accessibility tests for the previous labs and homework 1 as well, I gained proper basics from this week's topic.
